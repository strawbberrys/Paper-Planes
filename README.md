# Paper Planes

Knock down other players and upgrade your skills. Inspired by Garry's Mod Jenga.

I've decided to open source this project because I have no desire to work on it anymore.
It's still very much incomplete although the main functionality is working.
I don't really like the structure for this project, I mainly started it to help me learn some frameworks and although I accomplished that, it's obvious in the source that I was new to some things.
You can use this for whatever you want, I will not be updating this anymore and will instead be using this as a sample and as example work.
